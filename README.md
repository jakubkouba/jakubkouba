## Hi my  👋

### About me 👨
My name is Jacob and I'm a Ruby on Rails developer with **8+ years** experience. Currenlty dusting off my JavaScript skills, learning ⚛️ and node.js ecosystem.
I'm coding exercise enthusiast so you can find here a few here(e.g [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/jakubkouba/gilded_rose_kata) or [Tenis](https://github.com/jakubkouba/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata) kata)

In my free time I focus on personal and professional development, psychology and physical excercises. I like hiking and 🏕️ 

### 📚 I've read
- Clean Coder (Rober C. Martin)
- Objec Oriented Desing in Ruby (Sandi Metz)
- Xetreme Programing (Kent Beck)

### 🙂 Fun fact
I did a [pilgrimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago) to Santiago de Compostela (Portuguese central route 200 km from Bacelos)
