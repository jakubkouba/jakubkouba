## Hi my  👋

### About me 👨
My name is Jacob and I'm a Ruby on Rails developer with **9+ years** experience. Currently dusting off my JavaScript skills, learning ⚛️ and node.js ecosystem.
I'm a coding exercise enthusiast, so that you can find here a few here(e.g [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/jakubkouba/gilded_rose_kata) or [Tenis](https://github.com/jakubkouba/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata) kata)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my project, helping with the evaluation of the development level of kids with autism. It's a private project. I manage to:
  -  Set up Rails app using Hotwire and Stimulus with Materialized CSS and JS framework
  -  Configure CI/CD on GitHub to deploy to my VP in Digital Ocean
  -  App runs in a container managed by Kamal  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue.js. I finished a Pluralsight course recently available [here](https://github.com/jakubkouba/Build-A-Bot)

### 📚 I've read
- Clean Coder (Robert C. Martin)
- Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin)
- Object Oriented Design in Ruby (Sandi Metz)
- Extreme Programming (Kent Beck)

- In my free time, I focus on personal and professional development, psychology (C.G Jung), and physical exercise. I'm a fan of hiking, bushcrafting and 🏕️

### 🙂 Fun fact
I did a [pilgrimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago) to Santiago de Compostela (Portuguese central route 200 km from Bacelos)
